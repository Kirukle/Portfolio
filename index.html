      About Me 
    
    </h1>
    <h3> Living in Lynnwood, Washington.
    My aspiration is to be able to design media that compels distinct emotions in an audience from the encompassing atmosphere to the structure of the game level or to how a game mechanic may effect the player's experience.
      With playing games like Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider at a young age had me allows having a interest in video games but it wasn't until playing through Final Fantasy XIV that had such an impact to see that video games 
      have the power to give a truly impactful experience.
